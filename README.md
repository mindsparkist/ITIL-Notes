1\. Service Level Management:

Service level management is the process of defining, negotiating, monitoring, and reporting on **service level agreements (SLAs)** **and operational level agreements (OLAs).** It ensures that the agreed-upon service levels are met and maintained.

- SLAs are external agreements between the service provider and the customer, focused on service quality commitments.
- OLAs are internal agreements within the service provider organization, focused on the operational processes and interdependencies required to deliver the service defined in the SLA.
