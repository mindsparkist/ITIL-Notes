**Service Desk Technician: Resolving End User WiFi Issue**

**Scenario:** An end user, Sarah Lee, reports an inability to connect to the company WiFi network.

**End User Actions:**

1. Sarah contacts the IT service desk through a preferred channel (phone, email, self-service portal).
1. She describes the issue, including any error messages or troubleshooting attempts.

**Service Desk Technician Actions:**

1. **Gather Information:** The technician asks clarifying questions to understand the problem better. These might include:
   1. Device type (laptop, phone, etc.)
   1. Specific error messages encountered (if any)
   1. Recent changes to the device or network settings
   1. Troubleshooting steps already taken
1. **Initial Diagnosis:** Based on the gathered information, the technician attempts a basic diagnosis:
   1. **Knowledge Base Search:** They check for existing solutions or troubleshooting guides in the company's knowledge base.
   1. **Account Verification:** They verify if Sarah's device is registered on the network.
1. **Resolution:** Depending on the diagnosis, the technician takes these steps:
   1. **Simple Solution:** If the issue is user-specific and easily resolved (e.g., forgetting/reconnecting to the WiFi), the technician guides Sarah through the steps.
   1. **Remote Assistance:** With Sarah's permission, the technician may remotely access her device to adjust settings or troubleshoot further.
   1. **Escalation:** If the issue is beyond their expertise or requires network changes, the technician escalates the ticket to the appropriate team (e.g., network operations).
1. **Communication:** Throughout the process, the technician keeps Sarah updated via the chosen communication channel (phone call, email updates within the ticket system, etc.).

**Resolution and Follow-up:**

- **Successful Resolution:** If the technician resolves the issue, they document the solution in the ticket for future reference. Sarah receives confirmation that the issue is fixed.
- **Escalation:** If the issue requires further investigation, the technician clarifies the next steps with Sarah, including an estimated timeframe for resolution.

**Benefits of a Service Desk System:**

- **Streamlined Process:** The system guides technicians through a consistent workflow, ensuring efficient issue resolution.

MIR, or Major Incident Response, refers to a specific process within incident management that deals with high-impact events that significantly disrupt IT services or business operations. It's essentially an escalation plan for handling critical situations. Here's a breakdown of MIR:

**Purpose:**

- To ensure a swift and coordinated response to major incidents that threaten critical business functions.
- To minimize downtime, data loss, and financial impact associated with such incidents.

**Characteristics:**

- **High Impact:** Focused on incidents that cause widespread disruption or pose a significant risk to the organization. (e.g., Major system outage impacting all users, critical data breach)
- **Dedicated Team:** Often involves forming a dedicated Major Incident Response (MIR) team with representatives from various departments (IT, security, operations, management) to collaborate on resolving the issue.
- **Structured Approach:** Utilizes a pre-defined response plan outlining roles, responsibilities, communication protocols, and escalation procedures.
- **Communication & Transparency:** Effective communication with stakeholders, keeping everyone informed about the incident, progress, and estimated recovery time.

**Benefits:**

- **Faster Resolution:** Dedicated team and structured approach lead to quicker identification and resolution of major incidents.
- **Reduced Impact:** Minimizes downtime, data loss, and financial damages by responding swiftly and efficiently.
- **Improved Recovery:** Facilitates a smooth recovery process and helps get things back to normal as quickly as possible.

**Comparison with Standard Incident Management:**

While standard incident management handles all disruptions, MIR focuses specifically on critical events. Here's a table summarizing the key differences:

![](Aspose.Words.bf39ee28-325a-4c00-ab95-540de4afc167.003.png)


1. **Standard Changes:**
- **Description:** Pre-approved, low-impact, routine changes with well-defined procedures and minimal risk. Examples include adding a new user account, updating standard software versions, or replacing a failing hard drive with an identical model.
- **Process:** Often have a streamlined approval process or may even be pre-approved based on pre-defined criteria.
2. **Normal Changes:**
- **Description:** Planned changes that require a formal change request process with impact assessment and approval. These changes may have some degree of risk or require more resources compared to standard changes. Examples include installing a new software application, migrating data to a new server, or modifying network configurations.
- **Process:** Follow a defined change management workflow involving impact assessment, risk evaluation, approval by relevant stakeholders, and potentially a testing phase before deployment.
3. **Emergency Changes:**
- **Description:** Urgent changes required to address critical situations that pose a significant security risk or disruption to operations if left unaddressed. Examples include patching a critical security vulnerability, restoring a critical system outage, or taking action during a security breach.
- **Process:** Expedited approval process with limited review due to urgency. May involve higher risk due to the lack of extensive testing or impact assessment. A thorough review is still conducted after the situation stabilizes to assess effectiveness and identify lingering risks.

In addition to these main categories, some organizations might also use:

- **Major Changes:** These are significant changes with potentially high impact or risk, requiring a more comprehensive review and approval process compared to normal changes. Examples include implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or migrating to a cloud environment.

The specific types of change requests and their categorization might vary depending on the organization's size, structure, and risk tolerance.


**Change management**

IT change management is a systematic approach **to planning, implementing, and reviewing modifications to IT infrastructure**, systems, applications, or processes. Its primary goal is to minimize disruption and risk while ensuring the successful implementation of changes.

Typically involves a defined workflow with stages like:

- **Change Request:** A formal proposal outlining the change, its purpose, and potential impact.
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluation of potential risks and disruptions associated with the change.
- **Approval Process:** Review and authorization by relevant stakeholders based on the impact assessment.
- **Implementation & Testing:** Careful execution of the change with thorough testing to ensure functionality.
- **Deployment & Monitoring:** Deployment of the change to production and close monitoring for any issues.
- **Closure:** Documentation of the change process, lessons learned, and post-implementation review.

The main differences between standard, normal, and emergency change requests lie in their urgency, risk level, and approval process:

**Standard Change Request:**

* **Pre-approved:**  These are low-risk, routine changes that have already been reviewed and authorized by a Change Advisory Board (CAB) or similar body. 
* **Minimal Process:**  They often have a simplified approval process or may not require individual approval at all.  Some organizations may even automate standard changes.
* **Examples:** Updating software patches, adding a new user account with standard permissions, replacing aging hardware with the same model.

**Normal Change Request:**

* **Full Review:**  These are non-emergency changes that require a full assessment and approval process. 
* **Varied Risk:**  The risk level can vary from low to medium, and the impact on IT services can range from minimal to moderate.
* **Standard Process:**  They follow a defined change management process, which typically involves submitting a request, risk assessment, scheduling, and final approval from the CAB.
* **Examples:**  Installing new software, modifying network configurations, adding a new server.

**Emergency Change Request:**

* **Urgent Action:**  These are required to address critical issues that pose an immediate threat to business operations, such as security vulnerabilities or system outages. 
* **High Risk:**  They typically involve high risk and require immediate action to minimize downtime or damage. 
* **Expedited Process:**  The approval process is bypassed or significantly shortened to allow for a faster response. However, documentation and post-implementation review are still crucial.
* **Examples:**  Responding to a major security breach, restoring a critical system after a failure, implementing a hotfix for a critical bug.


Here's a table summarizing the key points:

| Feature                 | Standard Change Request | Normal Change Request | Emergency Change Request |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| Approval Process        | Pre-approved              | Full Review              | Expedited                |
| Risk Level               | Low                       | Low to Medium            | High                       |
| Urgency                  | Low                       | Non-urgent               | Urgent                     |
| Examples                 | Patches, User Accounts     | New Software, Network Config  | Security Breach, System Outage |

**Configuration Management**

Configuration management (CM) is the process of establishing and maintaining consistency in a system's attributes throughout its lifecycle. In simpler terms, it's about ensuring all the components of a system, like hardware, software, and settings, are set up and remain in the desired state.

Here's a breakdown of what CM involves:

- **Establishing a Baseline:** Defining the desired configuration for each element of the system. This includes hardware settings, software versions, security configurations, and any other relevant details.
- **Tracking Changes:** Monitoring and documenting any modifications made to the system's configuration. This ensures a clear history of changes and allows for reverting to previous states if necessary.
- **Maintaining Consistency:** Verifying that all components of the system adhere to the established baseline configuration. This helps prevent inconsistencies that might lead to malfunctions or security vulnerabilities.
- **Version Control:** Tracking different versions of the system configuration, allowing for rollbacks if issues arise after updates.

**Benefits of Configuration Management:**

- **Reduced Downtime:** By maintaining consistent configurations, CM helps prevent unexpected issues and minimizes downtime caused by inconsistencies.
- **Improved Security:** Consistent security configurations across the system minimize vulnerabilities and improve overall security posture.
- **Simplified Troubleshooting:** Documented configurations facilitate faster troubleshooting by providing a clear picture of the system's setup.
- **Enhanced Compliance:** CM helps ensure systems comply with internal policies and external regulations.
- **Improved Automation:** Standardized configurations enable automation of deployment and configuration management tasks, saving time and resources.

**Applications of Configuration Management:**

- **IT Infrastructure:** Managing configurations of servers, network devices, and other IT equipment.
- **Software Development:** Ensuring consistent configurations across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Security Management:** Maintaining consistent security configurations across all systems and devices.
- **Cloud Computing:** Managing configurations of virtual machines and cloud resources.

**Popular Configuration Management Tools:**

Creating Incident 

Creating Problem

Creating Knowledge article

A problem ticket in ServiceNow, also known as a problem record, is directly tied to the concept of **problem management** within the ITIL framework.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Purpose:**  Problem tickets help identify the underlying cause of recurring incidents and service disruptions. 
* **Focus:**  Unlike incident tickets that address specific occurrences, problem tickets aim to prevent future issues by finding the root cause. 
* **Creation:** Problem tickets can be created in a few ways:
    * **From Incidents:** The service desk might identify a need for further investigation after encountering repeated incidents and initiate a problem ticket.
    * **Proactive Approach:** IT teams can proactively create problem tickets if diagnostics reveal potential problems before they cause incidents. 
* **Information:** Problem tickets typically include details like:
    * Description of the issue
    * Affected systems or services
    * Related incident records (if any)
    * Progress updates during the investigation

**Benefits of Problem Tickets:**

* **Reduced Downtime:** By addressing root causes, problem management helps prevent recurring incidents and minimizes service disruptions.
* **Improved Efficiency:**  Resolving the underlying issue prevents IT teams from wasting time fixing the same symptoms repeatedly.
* **Proactive Approach:**  Problem management enables a proactive approach to IT service management, focusing on preventing problems rather than just reacting to incidents.

**In essence, problem tickets are like detective work in ServiceNow. They help diagnose the root cause of IT troubles and prevent future headaches!**


Parent and child tickets in ServiceNow establish a hierarchical relationship between incident reports. This helps track complex issues with multiple interrelated parts.

Here's how it works:

* **Parent Ticket:** This is the main incident record representing the overarching issue. It typically captures the high-level problem affecting multiple users or services.
* **Child Ticket:** These are individual incident reports that detail specific aspects or symptoms related to the parent issue. Each child ticket focuses on a smaller piece of the puzzle contributing to the bigger problem.

**Benefits of Parent-Child Relationships:**

* **Improved Organization:**  Breaking down a complex issue into smaller, more manageable parts makes troubleshooting and resolution easier.
* **Centralized View:**  The parent ticket provides a central location for all related information, offering a complete picture of the overall problem. 
* **Streamlined Communication:**  Updates made on the parent ticket automatically cascade down to child tickets, improving communication and information flow.
* **Efficient Resolution:**  By resolving child tickets contributing to the parent issue, technicians can effectively address the root cause and close the parent ticket.

**Here's an Example:**

Imagine a network outage affecting multiple departments (parent ticket). Each department experiencing issues might have a separate child ticket detailing specific symptoms like "no internet access" or "slow email performance." Resolving these child tickets (fixing network issues) would ultimately resolve the parent ticket (network outage).

**How to Create Parent-Child Tickets:**

* You can designate an existing incident as a parent by marking the "Is Child" checkbox and selecting the relevant parent incident number.
*  Alternatively, when creating a new incident, you can specify the parent ticket during the creation process.

**Overall, parent-child ticketing in ServiceNow helps organize complex issues, streamline workflows, and expedite resolution.**


SLA For SNOW
Link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjPFVcL248s

What is SLA? 

- It is basically a set of agreements between a
service provider and customer that defige the
scope, quality and speed of the services being
provided.

SLA VS OLA VS UC

Let me explain the key differences between SLAs, OLAs, and UCs in service management:

1. SLA (Service Level Agreement)
- External agreement between a service provider and its customers
- Defines expected service quality, availability, responsibilities
- Example: "99.9% system uptime, 24-hour response time for critical issues"
- Focused on end-user experience and business outcomes

2. OLA (Operational Level Agreement)
- Internal agreement between different departments/teams within an organization
- Supports the SLA by defining how teams work together
- Example: "IT Infrastructure team will respond to Network team requests within 2 hours"
- Details specific operational metrics and responsibilities

3. UC (Underpinning Contract)
- Agreement between an organization and external third-party suppliers/vendors
- Ensures external support for delivering SLAs
- Example: "Cloud provider guarantees 99.99% infrastructure availability"
- Defines vendor obligations, penalties, and support terms

Key relationships:
- SLAs are supported by OLAs and UCs
- OLAs coordinate internal teams to meet SLA requirements
- UCs ensure external vendors provide necessary support

Difference between "Response" and "Resolution" SLA?

Response and Resolution SLAs are two distinct but related metrics in service management:

Response SLA:

- Measures the time taken to initially acknowledge/respond to an incident/request
- Usually involves first contact with the customer
- Example: "High priority tickets must receive first response within 30 minutes"
- Typically includes:
  - Auto-reply confirmations
  - Initial ticket assignment
  - First human contact
  - Basic ticket categorization

Resolution SLA:
- Measures the total time taken to completely solve the issue
- Tracks from ticket creation to final resolution
- Example: "Critical incidents must be resolved within 4 hours"
- Includes:
  - Investigation time
  - Implementation of solution
  - Customer verification
  - Ticket closure

Common Structure:
Priority | Response Time | Resolution Time
Critical | 30 minutes   | 4 hours
High     | 1 hour       | 8 hours
Medium   | 4 hours      | 24 hours
Low      | 8 hours      | 48 hours

Note: The clock may "pause" during:
- Customer response waiting time
- After-hours periods (if not 24/7 support)
- Scheduled maintenance windows

Different Stages of SLA?

Different Stages of SLA's:

•In Progress
- Achieved (can be identified through "has breached" field)
- Breached (can be identified through "has breached" field and with red filled
circle displayed in Stage field)
•Paused
•Competed
•Cancelled

Actual Elapsed Time VS Business  Elapsed Time

Let me explain the key differences between Actual Elapsed Time and Business Elapsed Time:

Actual Elapsed Time (AET):
- Also known as "Calendar Time" or "Clock Time"
- Measures time continuously (24/7/365)
- Includes ALL time periods:
  - Weekends
  - Holidays
  - After-hours
  - Lunch breaks
- Example: If a ticket is created Friday at 5 PM and resolved Monday at 9 AM
  - AET = 64 hours (includes entire weekend)

Business Elapsed Time (BET):
- Also known as "Business Hours" or "Working Hours"
- Only counts time during defined business hours
- Excludes:
  - Non-working hours
  - Weekends
  - Public holidays
  - Scheduled maintenance windows
- Example: If a ticket is created Friday at 5 PM and resolved Monday at 9 AM
  - BET = 1 hour (assuming 9 AM-5 PM business hours)
  - Only counts the 1 hour on Monday morning

Important Considerations:
1. SLAs typically use BET for calculations
2. Different support levels may have different business hours:
   - Standard: 9 AM-5 PM, Mon-Fri
   - Extended: 8 AM-8 PM, Mon-Sat
   - 24/7: AET and BET would be the same

What is "Retroactive start" in SLA's?

Link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY098MB7bTE

A Retroactive Start in SLAs refers to when the SLA clock begins counting from a time before the actual ticket creation or assignment. Here's a detailed explanation:

Definition:
- SLA timer starts counting from a point in the past
- Often used to account for system delays or customer wait times
- Can be applied to both Response and Resolution SLAs

Common Use Cases:
1. Email Delays
   - Customer sends email at 9:00 AM
   - System creates ticket at 9:15 AM
   - SLA retroactively starts at 9:00 AM

2. Phone Support
   - Customer waits in queue for 10 minutes
   - Ticket created after agent answers
   - SLA includes queue waiting time

3. System Outages
   - System goes down at 2:00 PM
   - Ticket created at 2:30 PM
   - SLA clock starts at 2:00 PM

Benefits:
- More accurate reflection of actual customer wait time
- Better measurement of true service quality
- Fairer accountability for support teams
- Helps identify system delays and bottlenecks

Example Setup:
- Ticket created: 10:30 AM
- First customer contact time: 10:15 AM
- Retroactive start applied
- SLA clock begins: 10:15 AM
