![](Aspose.Words.bf39ee28-325a-4c00-ab95-540de4afc167.003.png)


1. **Standard Changes:**
- **Description:** Pre-approved, low-impact, routine changes with well-defined procedures and minimal risk. Examples include adding a new user account, updating standard software versions, or replacing a failing hard drive with an identical model.
- **Process:** Often have a streamlined approval process or may even be pre-approved based on pre-defined criteria.
2. **Normal Changes:**
- **Description:** Planned changes that require a formal change request process with impact assessment and approval. These changes may have some degree of risk or require more resources compared to standard changes. Examples include installing a new software application, migrating data to a new server, or modifying network configurations.
- **Process:** Follow a defined change management workflow involving impact assessment, risk evaluation, approval by relevant stakeholders, and potentially a testing phase before deployment.
3. **Emergency Changes:**
- **Description:** Urgent changes required to address critical situations that pose a significant security risk or disruption to operations if left unaddressed. Examples include patching a critical security vulnerability, restoring a critical system outage, or taking action during a security breach.
- **Process:** Expedited approval process with limited review due to urgency. May involve higher risk due to the lack of extensive testing or impact assessment. A thorough review is still conducted after the situation stabilizes to assess effectiveness and identify lingering risks.

In addition to these main categories, some organizations might also use:

- **Major Changes:** These are significant changes with potentially high impact or risk, requiring a more comprehensive review and approval process compared to normal changes. Examples include implementing a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or migrating to a cloud environment.

The specific types of change requests and their categorization might vary depending on the organization's size, structure, and risk tolerance.


**Change management**

IT change management is a systematic approach **to planning, implementing, and reviewing modifications to IT infrastructure**, systems, applications, or processes. Its primary goal is to minimize disruption and risk while ensuring the successful implementation of changes.

Typically involves a defined workflow with stages like:

- **Change Request:** A formal proposal outlining the change, its purpose, and potential impact.
- **Impact Assessment:** Evaluation of potential risks and disruptions associated with the change.
- **Approval Process:** Review and authorization by relevant stakeholders based on the impact assessment.
- **Implementation & Testing:** Careful execution of the change with thorough testing to ensure functionality.
- **Deployment & Monitoring:** Deployment of the change to production and close monitoring for any issues.
- **Closure:** Documentation of the change process, lessons learned, and post-implementation review.

The main differences between standard, normal, and emergency change requests lie in their urgency, risk level, and approval process:

**Standard Change Request:**

* **Pre-approved:**  These are low-risk, routine changes that have already been reviewed and authorized by a Change Advisory Board (CAB) or similar body. 
* **Minimal Process:**  They often have a simplified approval process or may not require individual approval at all.  Some organizations may even automate standard changes.
* **Examples:** Updating software patches, adding a new user account with standard permissions, replacing aging hardware with the same model.

**Normal Change Request:**

* **Full Review:**  These are non-emergency changes that require a full assessment and approval process. 
* **Varied Risk:**  The risk level can vary from low to medium, and the impact on IT services can range from minimal to moderate.
* **Standard Process:**  They follow a defined change management process, which typically involves submitting a request, risk assessment, scheduling, and final approval from the CAB.
* **Examples:**  Installing new software, modifying network configurations, adding a new server.

**Emergency Change Request:**

* **Urgent Action:**  These are required to address critical issues that pose an immediate threat to business operations, such as security vulnerabilities or system outages. 
* **High Risk:**  They typically involve high risk and require immediate action to minimize downtime or damage. 
* **Expedited Process:**  The approval process is bypassed or significantly shortened to allow for a faster response. However, documentation and post-implementation review are still crucial.
* **Examples:**  Responding to a major security breach, restoring a critical system after a failure, implementing a hotfix for a critical bug.


Here's a table summarizing the key points:
